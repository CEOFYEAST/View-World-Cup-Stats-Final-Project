This website relies on RapidAPI API calls, which can start to cost money after a few uses. Therefore, I removed my own RapidAPI key from the program, and you'll have to insert your own in the neccesary locations; you won't be able to use any of the pages otherwise. There are four locations in Leaders.js, and one in the three other js files. The easiest way to locate them is by hitting ctrl f, and searching for instances of 'insert your key here' in a given file.
